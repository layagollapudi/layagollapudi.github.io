                    I am a current student at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science and Economics. I'm very interested in learning about how technology plays a role in various modern industries. ML / AI Algorithm research, Computer Vision, and Data Systems are fields I would love to get more involved with.

                    I've always been interested in helping out others with whatever skills and abilities that I may have. I especially love teaching and working with children, so I have volunteered as an assistant teacher in various settings. I really love being able to learn from those who I am helping as well, and decided to develop this interest by working with students in India to introduce a more well-rounded education system.

                    Since I was young, I've been singing Carnatic Indian classical music, playing the piano and learning the flute. I started singing when I was 6 years old, and have been performing at local and national events since. As a college, I continue to foster my passion for the Carnatic arts as a member of my school's South Asian Music Ensemble. I learned piano from a classically trained instructor for 6 years, and have been self-taught ever since. I started the flute in 4th grade as a part of our school band and continuted through the band program until the 8th grade, where I switched to joining private ensembles and working on solo performances. My experiences with musical performance also inspired me to start composing music - mainly for the piano - and submitting to various contests.
