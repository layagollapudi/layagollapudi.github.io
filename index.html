                <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                <p>
                    I am a current student at the University of Chicago studying Computer Science and Economics. I'm very interested in learning about how technology plays a role in various modern industries. ML / AI Algorithm research, Computer Vision, and Data Systems are fields I would love to get more involved with.

                <h4>Interested in tech - the start?</h4>
                <p>
                    My mother, a software engineer and computer scientist, and my father, a computer and electrical engineer, are by far my two largest inspirations for my interest in technology. Seeing my mom as a strong independent woman in tech and my dad get really excited about testing his companys' new products always kept potentially going down such a route a possibility in the back of my mind. My friends in highschool also were planning on expanding their programming knowledge as well, so I decided to try out what they were doing and take a CS class. It was tough, but the reward of creating something after hours of debugging made it all totally worth it.

                  <p>
                      I've always been interested in helping out others with whatever skills and abilities that I may have. I especially love teaching and working with children, so I have volunteered as an assistant teacher in various settings. I really love being able to learn from those who I am helping as well, and decided to develop this interest by working with students in India to introduce a more well-rounded education system.

                      Since I was young, I've been singing Carnatic Indian classical music, playing the piano and learning the flute. I started singing when I was 6 years old, and have been performing at local and national events since. As a college, I continue to foster my passion for the Carnatic arts as a member of my school's South Asian Music Ensemble. I learned piano from a classically trained instructor for 6 years, and have been self-taught ever since. I started the flute in 4th grade as a part of our school band and continuted through the band program until the 8th grade, where I switched to joining private ensembles and working on solo performances. My experiences with musical performance also inspired me to start composing music - mainly for the piano - and submitting to various contests.

                <h4>My musical origins?</h4>
                <p>
                    I started learning Carnatic music, a form of classical Indian music,
                    when I was about 5 years old. I was very involved from a young age, competing
                    in competitions and performing at various recitals. Around the same time, I
                    also took piano lessons, with which I was not as involved with but still
                    practicing and performing. Later, in elementary school, I started learning
                    how to play the flute as part of my school band, with which I played both solo
                    and group performances throughout my K-12 school years.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>How have I come to define music?</h4>
                <p>
                    I had always loved practicing music as I was instructed by my teachers and gurus,
                    but I also came to realize how much of my musical interests stemmed from the freedom
                    I had as a musician and a performer. I most appreciated the freedom of artistry.
                    I started trying to learn and arrange pieces by ear [thank you very much, perfect
                    pitch] as well as experiment with composition styles and performance textures. I started
                    to play around with and mix different styles of music that I was learning together.
